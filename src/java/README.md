<!-- README.md -->

This project has been set up to run on a Java server, you can create a war with 'grunt war' command, and deploy it. Included is a Cache fileter and a GZip Filter to cache and compress data.

Also, a web.xml is defined, you will need to alter this file if you want a dynamic rather than static project. Probably best to use an editor like Eclipse to create such a project. Otherwise the 'grunt war' command should suffice for your static project.
